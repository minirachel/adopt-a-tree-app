# Adopt-A-Tree
Adopt-A-Tree is a Sinatra-based web app to track and monitor your locally adopted trees.

## Usage
You can sign up for an account to add your own adopted Tree and add daily journal entries. View other user's entries or edit/delete your own! This is based off of the Greenpoint Tree Corp's wonderful program & weekly tracking forms.

This app is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).


## Code of Conduct
Everyone interacting in the NycGreenthumbGardens project's codebases, issue trackers, chat rooms and mailing lists is expected to follow the code of conduct.

## Land Acknowledgement

We (the app creators and users) acknowledge that the land used for the NYC Parks Tree Census and this adoption program are on the unceded land of the Lenape and Canarsie peoples. We acknowledge the Lenape and Canarsie communities, their elders both past and present, as well as future generations. This acknowledgement demonstrates a commitment to beginning the process of working to dismantle the ongoing legacies of settler colonialism.
